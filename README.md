This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to distinguish between real human faces and synthetic faces generated by Artificial Intelligence. Developed as part of a research study at Fırat University.

## 📌 Project Overview
With the rise of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), distinguishing between real and synthetic media has become crucial for digital security. This project focuses on binary classification of facial images using deep learning techniques.

### Key Results:
* **Dataset Size:** 9,936 images (5,000 Real, 4,936 AI-generated).
* **Model:** Custom CNN architecture with 3 Convolutional blocks.
* **Performance:** High precision and F1-score in detecting synthetic artifacts.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
1.  **Preprocessing:** Images resized to 224x224 and normalized (1/255).
2.  **Architecture:**
    * 3x Conv2D Layers (32, 64, 128 filters) with ReLU activation.
    * MaxPooling layers for spatial reduction.
    * Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting.
    * Sigmoid output for binary classification.
3.  **Optimization:** Adam optimizer with Binary Crossentropy loss.
